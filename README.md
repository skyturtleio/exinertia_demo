# Exinertia Demo

This is pretty much the same demo application as [monolith](https://github.com/skyturtleio/monolith); however assets are generated and mangaged using [Vite.js](https://vite.dev/) and [Bun](https://hexdocs.pm/bun/Bun.html). The setup to get all of the Inertia.js boilerplate was done using [ExInertia](https://github.com/nordbeam/exinertia).
